    This tool works by looking for specific sequences of bytecodes within the
    class files. The files are scanned <i>locally</i> in your browser with
    JavaScript and aren't sent to a remove server.
  </div>
  <div style="margin-bottom: 20px; max-width: 800px">
    Be aware of false positives (it's possible but unlikely that a class file
    contains the same bytecode sequence as this tool is looking for) and false
    negatives (it's possible that a class file is infected but doesn't contain
    the same bytecode sequence as this tool is looking for).
